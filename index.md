# Dominion of Light

This is the start of a great journey. The creation of Dominion of Light the game.

## Mission

Although this project may never get truly released but there are other goals I wish to achieve with this project.

- __Unlimited game play__ - This is at the core of the games design
- Unlimited character building
  - Skill progression based on how you play not a point system
- Massive open world
  - Improbable to explore entirely
  - Persistence
  - Never the same when revisiting
  - Evolving with AI based factions that govern everything even nature
- New quests all the time that evolve with the world
  - Minor quest opportunities everywhere
  - Full campaigns form automatically
  - No static story lines
- Tell the Dominion of Light story
  - For 15 years I have been working on this story and its time to tell it.

## Road Map

This road map is not based on a web approach but rather a native app. Still a 3 phased approach. First, a console app to refine back end mechanics and generative algorithms.
Then a Unity PC game with basic UI. Next, refinement of the app for users and potentially a closed door pre-release.
After refinement a Greenlight project on Steam to get more testers and backing to refine further.

The following is the current road map subject to change.
