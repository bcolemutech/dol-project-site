# Dominion of Light

This is the start of a great journey. The creation of Dominion of Light the game. This game is a Google Cloud hosted world. The first phase of the game is a web based app. As the game world evolves new features will be released to the app. The web app will be used to build out the SDK for future phases (Unity).

## Mission

Although this project may never get truly released but there are many other goals I wish to achieve with this project.

- __Unlimited game play__ - This is at the core of the games design
- Unlimited character building
  - Skill progression based on how you play not a point system
- Massive open world
  - Improbable to explore entirely
  - Persistence
  - Never exactly the same when revisiting
  - Evolving with AI based factions that govern everything even nature
- New quests all the time that evolve with the world
  - Minor quest opportunities everywhere
  - Full campaigns form automatically
  - No static story lines
- Tell the Dominion of Light story
  - This world has been designed, refactored, and grown for over 15 years.
  - It is my favorite creation

## Road Map

The road map has been revised from the web approach to a native app. Still a 3 phased approach. First, a console app to refine back end mechanics and generative algorithms.
Then a Unity PC game with basic UI. Next, refinement of the app for users and potentially a closed door pre-release.
Finally, after refinement a Greenlight project on Steam to get more testers and backing to refine further.

The following is the current road map subject to change.
